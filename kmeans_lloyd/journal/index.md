# Lloyd k-means in the Python array API

## What this PR explores

This experiment studies nearest-centroid assignment, Lloyd updates, empty
clusters, and centroid initialization through the Python array API. The eager
implementation runs with PyTorch on CPU, CUDA, and XPU, with CuPy on CUDA,
and with dpnp on a Level Zero GPU.
Comparisons cover stock scikit-learn, scikit-learn with k-means++ performance
patches, Cython, and cuML.

The journal progresses from kernel-fusion probes to bounded-memory tiled
assignment, full fits, repeated-seed and shared-start comparisons, empty-center
relocation, and greedy versus scalable initialization. The current six-task mix
spans 3 to 3000 clusters, 2 to 1000 features, and 135000 to 2100000 samples,
including a balanced 256-cluster, 128-feature case. Runs use float32, eager
execution, TF32 disabled, three seeds, and a 60-second worker limit.

## Latest results

[023](023-dpnp-array-api/index.html) adds the portable array-API path on dpnp
GPU arrays to the [022](022-intel-arc-xpu/index.html) Arc B390 measurements.
022 holds PyTorch XPU (native and one-hot), PyTorch CPU, stock scikit-learn
1.9.1, and cakedev0. CuPy and cuML are absent on this host.

Main conclusions:

- dpnp, which always uses the one-hot update, is faster than native Torch CPU
  on every full fit. It is also faster than the XPU one-hot update at 17
  clusters (2.57 s against 2.83 s) and at 256 (1.11 s against 1.87 s).
- The XPU one-hot update remains the fastest full fit at 3 clusters (3.22 s;
  dpnp is 4.83 s). From 17 clusters up, cakedev0 is still the fastest full fit.
  dpnp is second at 17 clusters (2.57 s against 2.35 s) and at 256 (1.11 s
  against 1.06 s).
- At 256 clusters dpnp Lloyd takes 0.47 s, level with stock scikit-learn and
  cakedev0. At 550 and 3000 clusters both XPU updates and Cython Lloyd are
  faster than dpnp.
- On Arc B390 the one-hot PyTorch update is faster than `index_add_` through
  256 clusters (022). The CUDA few-cluster cutoff would keep `index_add_` on
  `k17-d180`, where the one-hot update is the faster XPU path.
