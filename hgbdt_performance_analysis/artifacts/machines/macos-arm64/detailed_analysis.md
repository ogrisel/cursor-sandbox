### Underperformance findings and root cause analysis

- Root cause signal: Python-level dispatch/orchestration contributes meaningfully to sklearn runtime.
- Issue (single_thread, dataset `medium`): Best sklearn total is 1.284x slower than best alternative at thread=1.
  - Implementation plan:
    - Move short-lived orchestration loops to Cython/C-level helpers.
    - Preallocate and reuse temporary buffers in split and histogram kernels.
    - Add lightweight fast paths for small-node splits to bypass heavy orchestration.
- Issue (single_thread, dataset `small`): Best sklearn total is 1.588x slower than best alternative at thread=1.
  - Implementation plan:
    - Move short-lived orchestration loops to Cython/C-level helpers.
    - Preallocate and reuse temporary buffers in split and histogram kernels.
    - Add lightweight fast paths for small-node splits to bypass heavy orchestration.
- Issue (scalability, dataset `small`): Best sklearn speedup trails best alternative by 0.273 (1->regular max threads).
  - Implementation plan:
    - Move short-lived orchestration loops to Cython/C-level helpers.
    - Preallocate and reuse temporary buffers in split and histogram kernels.
    - Add lightweight fast paths for small-node splits to bypass heavy orchestration.
- Issue (oversubscription, dataset `small`): At 2x cores, sklearn fit-time ratio vs cores is 1.860 vs 1.201 for best alternative.
  - Implementation plan:
    - Move short-lived orchestration loops to Cython/C-level helpers.
    - Preallocate and reuse temporary buffers in split and histogram kernels.
    - Add lightweight fast paths for small-node splits to bypass heavy orchestration.
